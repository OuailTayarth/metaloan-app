# MetaLoan: Own Your Piece of the Metaverse

MetaLoan is a full-stack application built with React on the front end and Polygon blockchain on the back end for storing data. It helps users own metaverse land by offering affordable loan payments. The app uses smart contracts and blockchain for transparent and efficient loan processing, making virtual ownership accessible to everyone.

## Reason for Building This App

I built this project during my last role as a front-end developer at Rose Law Group, the company I was working at. It makes owning metaverse land affordable by breaking down high costs into small payments, helping more people join virtual worlds for fun or investment.
